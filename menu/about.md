I'm Joshua Rogers, originally from Melbourne, Australia. These days I live in Poland.

I'm currently working at [Opera Software](https://opera.com/) as a Security Engineer on a ton of awesome projects (and with awesome people).

I studied Applied Mathematics and Cinema/Film Studies at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, completing both a BSc and a BA with an overall GPA of 3.25. People always tell me that Mathematics and Film is a weird mix: but I think, in a way, they complement each other.

My main interests include (but are not limited to):
- Algorithmics
- Architecture
- Cybersecurity
- Film/Cinema Studies
- Mathematics
- Music (Melodic House, Melodic Techno, House)
- Programming
- Sport (Bicycle Riding, Weight Lifting, Rock Climbing, Rowing)
- Video Game History

I'm an outgoing person and love to talk to people. I like presenting and discussing topics I'm interested in, too, because it gives me an opportunity to test my knowledge; that's one of my gripes about the IT industry -- the lack of social events and contact.

I like learning new things and usually put myself in situations which require learning new skills, whether they're technical, physical, or social. If you think you have a project like that, you should [contact me](/contact.html).

I'm working on my ability to speak Polish, and Russian. I can understand Polish fairly well and can read most (non-technical!) documents in the language. Likewise, the Russian language has always fascinated me, and while I did take classes for a while, it has lagged behind my learning of Polish.

Officially speaking, I'm writing a book about the history of Nintendo in Europe, Australia, and some other places around the world. But that's going extremely slowly.
