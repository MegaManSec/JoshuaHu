Joshua Rogers. Originally from Melbourne, Australia. These days I live in Poland.

I'm currently working at [Opera Software](https://opera.com/) doing all things security: Devsecops, pentesting, security engineering, security architecture, incident response, security research, network security, and general consulstancy. You'd think I just chose every field in the online security realm, but no, I truly have to do all of these things. Some call me an all-rounder due to my ability to jump into nearly any situation and get the ball rolling immediately.

Moonlighting as a party hostel receptionist, bartender, pubcrawl/boatparty guide in Krak√≥w.

I have a BSc in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Cinema/Film studies. I have years of sysadmin experience (linux and freebsd) and even more in security.

My hobbies, interests, and general topics that I'm passionate about include:
- Architecture
- Cybersecurity
- Film History
- Human Rights
- Mathematics
- Music (Melodic House, Melodic Techno, House, Rap) [(My Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3wfARljUCoGyEGmFbjyvo3?si=a7b3eeb5d0894d10)
- Sport (Bicycle Riding, Weight Lifting, Rock Climbing, Rowing)
- Video Game History

New things excite me and I like putting myself into situations that require learning new skills, whether they're technical, physical, or social.

If you think you have a project like that, you should [contact me](/contact.html).

I like presenting and discussing topics I'm interested in, because it gives me an opportunity to test my knowledge. I've had the privilege of speaking as a domain expert at several conferences.

Since living in Poland, I've taught myself B2 Polish. Sometimes I can speak Russian from some learning I did years ago.

Currently, my primary focus revolves around the global alleviation of human suffering. I firmly believe that we can improve the human condition and reduce unnecessary suffering on a worldwide scale.
