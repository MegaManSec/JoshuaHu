title: About Me
---

My name is Joshua Rogers. I am originally from Melbourne, Australia, but these days live in Krakow, Poland. As of writing this page, I am 24-years old.

I'm currently working at [Opera Software](https://opera.com/) as a Security Engineer on a ton of awesome projects (and with awesome people), and I've previously worked in the tourism and events industry, which I've loved too!

I studied Applied Mathematics and Cinema/Film Studies at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, completing both a BSc and a BA with an overall GPA of 3.25. People always tell me that Mathematics and Film is a weird mix: but I think, in a way, they complement each other.

My main interests include (but are not limited to):
- Algorithmics
- Architecture
- Bicycle Riding
- Cybersecurity
- Film/Cinema Studies
- Mathematics
- Music
- Programming
- Video Game History
- Weight Lifting

I'm an outgoing person and love to talk to people. I like presenting and discussing topics I'm interested in, too, because it gives me an opportunity to test my knowledge; that's one of the best parts of working in the events' industry, too -- the social circles.

I don't know whether I'm an entrepreneur, but I like learning about new things and usually put myself in situations which require learning new skills, whether they're technical, physical, or social.

I'm working on my ability to speak Polish, and Russian. While I can understand Polish fairly well and can read most (non-technical!) documents in the language, being able to formulate sentences which are not simply word-for-word transliterations is difficult. Since I have Polish citizenship, I feel obliged to learn the language. Likewise, the Russian language has always fascinated me, and while I did take classes for a while, it has lagged behind my learning of Polish.
