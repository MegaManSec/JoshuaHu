---

Wrocław is a medium-sized city located in the west of Poland. With an official population of 640,000 (with many hundreds of thousands likely not included in this statistic), it is Poland's fourth largest city.
Previously a part of Bohemia (Czechia), the Austrian Empire, Prussia and Germany (where it was known as, and is still the official name, "Breslau"; at the train station, for example, you can still see manhole covers entitled 'Breslau'), the city was [largely destroyed during World War 2](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/defense-breslau-germany-fights.html), however was rebuilt: now, the city is a cultural and business hub for Poland.

During your visit to the Wrocław, there are many things to see and do throughout the city (and beyond).

**Some things to note about the city**

-   Crossing the street at any place except for traffic lights can really get you a fine in Poland.
-   Drinking is illegal in public.
-   Other than the worst kebabs of your life, it is difficult to find any type of food to buy after around 22:00 (this is true for all of Poland).
-   "Floor 0" means the ground floor in Poland.
-   The airport is not far from the city center, and you can either the city-bus number 106 (it takes around 30 minutes), or some type of taxi. As always in foreign countries, it's best to use apps like Uber, Bolt, or a more local app "Free Now" to order a taxi.
-   Don't expect friendly service in Poland, and if you ask for water you'll have to specify you want it from the tap (which is 100% drinkable in Wrocław).
-   Most young people will speak some level of English, while the older generation may not speak any English at all. Don't be afraid to try!
-   Sundays in Poland are a holy day in which most stores are legally obliged to be closed (with some exceptions). If you're planning to buy anything on Sunday, be prepared to have nearly no options (see Supermarkets).
-   A couple of small stores operate in the city which are open nearly 24/7, but otherwise everything is closed at 23:00 until around 05:00.
-   The sale of alcohol from shops (not bars/restaurants) is forbidden from 22:00 - 06:00 in the main part of the city.
-   Trams are cheap and the most common app people use to buy tickets is <https://jakdojade.pl>: when using it in Wrocław, you need to enter the "number" of the tram/bus when boarding, and it can be found somewhere on the ceiling of the vehicle (something like ND340).

**Sightseeing**

-   [Amfiteatralna pier](https://goo.gl/maps/eDapzvyWTBuzYVVPA) and the general area by the river is a nice walk, and very beautiful in the evening to watch the sunset.
-   [Plac Solny](https://goo.gl/maps/jzpeJwwdVDYeA87g7), which is just off the market square, hosts flower stalls and other lively activities throughout the year.
-   [The "Colorful Backyards of Nadodrze"](https://goo.gl/maps/NvufCyHEEFkWqnS89) is an art project which was produced in the "backyard" of three different housing estates. In each of the estates, the walls of the buildings were painted with beautiful paintings. It may be difficult to find this area without directions, but [this link](https://goo.gl/maps/thQ6PCBj5Sx8SCNs7) should get you close enough to find it yourself.
-   [The "Fosa"](https://goo.gl/maps/5FRaTUPm8pJLfxLB8) (water moat) which surrounds the southern part of the Wrocław old town is a nice walk, too.
-   [The Centennial Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/Y4oVjLn2raLC7Cor5) (and the surroundings) **is by far the most important sight to see in Wrocław**. One of the two UNESCO sites in Wrocław it features various gardens (including a [Japanese Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/vPyTHzWFS2a4CJkR7)), and a huge [colourfully-lit fountain](https://goo.gl/maps/BBP34MPNPJoNtBXn8). Due to its groundbreaking and innovative use of reinforced concrete (unheard of in 1913), it has since become a cultural hub and is often visited for the events held within the hall, as well as the beauty of its surroundings. On the west side of the hall, a large spire ("[Iglica](https://goo.gl/maps/M73zDMeZcBVxpFkRA)", literally in Polish, "little needle") also stands tall.

While out and about, you may (you'd *have* to be trying to not) see small dwarf statues around the city. With hundreds (nearing 1,000 now!) throughout the city and surrounding areas, these started off as recognition to the anti-communist movement in Wrocław in the '80s. [Read more about them here](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20171017-the-truth-behind-wrocaws-cheeky-gnomes).

It is free to enter on Saturday.

This gallery (which is also a store) is most likely a branch of the famous "[Dydo Poster Gallery](https://dydopostergallery.com/en/)" in Kraków (which itself has seasonal exhibitions on top of its permanent historical and reprinted posters). These posters are likely compared to nothing you've seen before, even for the films you know -- note: Polish film names are commonly wildly different from their original (albeit commonly making sense), such as Die Hard -> Glass Trap, The Hangover -> Vegas Hangover, Fight Club ->The Underground Circle, The Full Monty -> Naked and Furious, The Terminator -> Electronic Murderer, Rear Window -> Window to the Courtyard.

Despite the large variety of foreign restaurants in Wrocław (and in Poland in general), many of them struggle to provide truly authentic tastes and flavors from the cuisines they offer and are often modified and toned down to suit the Polish palate, which is less accustomed to the nuances of other cultures' cuisines (especially spiciness). As a result, while many restaurants try to provide a culinary experience similar to that they originate from, they often do not fully capture the true essence and traditional preparation methods that one would experience in the respective countries, instead offering "adaptations". It's also difficult to get good sushi and other fish-related dishes in Poland since Poland does not have so many fish:). Nonetheless, there are some excellent places to eat in Wrocław, and all of the ones below pass the "Taste Test" of the author of this article; your mileage may vary.

Note: some of these restaurants provide a very small discount for Opera employees. You can check out the discounts available [on this wiki page](https://wiki.opera.software/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=168725517).

This may be due to the fact they: they are prepared in questionable conditions, every sushi place in Europe is a money-laundering front, or because the kitchen required to prepare sushi is tiny; you need a fridge, a rice cooker, and a bench. Nonetheless, delivery-only sushi nearly always better than other places. I recommend checking out Ubereats or one of the other apps, ordering some sushi to a park, and enjoying it outside if it's nice weather.

**Korean:**

-   -   [Korill180](https://goo.gl/maps/QYJEupjXQRr8erLu9): Korean BBQ.
    -   [Kyunghone](https://goo.gl/maps/XPq2zSY6UGcYA7kK9): Slightly further away from the city, this place offers truly authentic Korean food, which hasn't been modified too much for Polish taste-buds.
    -   [Oseyo 25](https://goo.gl/maps/fkmTrRhmb9uG5nkS6): Teppanyaki, Bibimbap, Gimbap, Fried Chicken, Shabu Shabu (Hot Pot), Ramen, Korean BBQ, and more.
    -   [SOLLEIM 설레임](https://goo.gl/maps/MX7BUi3HGeUeXwBK9): Fried Chicken in the city center.

**Mexican:**

-   -   [El Gordito](https://g.co/kgs/LmJQcG)
    -   [Mexico Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/PP2NfH8v4Mn3p5877)

**Middle Eastern:**

-   -   [Jaffa Bar&Market](https://goo.gl/maps/q8N7DDtcLXA65sLj8)
    -   [Kasprowicza24](https://goo.gl/maps/wGEffWHXxsBCbxad8): Poland is full of low-quality low-cost "kebab" (meat sliced from 4-am-delivered frozen sticks which is made from the unsellable meat of some animal) and is often joked about due to Polish nationalists love for this "foreign food". Kasprowicza24 is not that. Located next to the Muslim Cultural and Educational Center, the meat and vegetables are fresh, it doesn't smell like chemicals, and the hummus is home-made.
    -   [Hommus Libańskie jedzenie Gyros & Grill](https://goo.gl/maps/3c4ELBP8ciegUSim9): Similar to the one above.

**Modern European:**

-   -   [Aksameet Bistro Restauracja](https://goo.gl/maps/eQ6CtFHNuLwdatxD8)
    -   [The Cork](https://goo.gl/maps/FTRv11r4tw1JogQ27)
    -   [La Maddalena](https://goo.gl/maps/1Czpjmg6PfeZDyvN6): One of the most expensive restaurants in Wrocław, this is a place if you want to go for "fine dining".
    -   [Nafta Neo Bistro](https://goo.gl/maps/jyukv1zKcb9o66Nv9): A modern take on Polish cuisine, it's not the "cheap polish food that grandmum used to make":).
    -   [Restauracja Przystań & Marina](https://goo.gl/maps/vmSLmEaGDNv1ZQh26): One of the most expensive restaurants in Wrocław, this is a place if you want to go for "fine dining".
    -   [STÓŁ na Szwedzkiej - studio kulinarne](https://goo.gl/maps/tHXZExdhdu7gthYFA): More than just a restaurant, this place advertises itself as a "culinary studio" due to its option kitchen, and the general menu-less design: you chat with the chefs about your flavor preferences, and they make something up! They have extremely unusual ingredients and the whole visit there is an experience more than just food: they also do workshops!

**Peruvian:**

-   -   [Peruwiana](https://goo.gl/maps/MLeXpEAbJpUHQNoMA)

**Spanish:**

-   -   [Mercado Tapas Bistro](https://goo.gl/maps/mi6qdpFiBZ8LekfK6)

**Polish:**

-   -   [Bar Mleczny Mikrus](https://goo.gl/maps/MF1CUzNaaUju8Vh7A): A bit far from the city, if you have the time, I highly recommend you visit this "bar mleczny" (milk bar). to give some context to what "bar mleczny" means, I recommend you read [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_mleczny). They serve cheap Polish classics in what can only be described as a canteen. Historically, it doesn't get any more Polish than this.
    -   [Bar Mleczny Miś](https://goo.gl/maps/Z3rcvimr54V14TJs9): Another bar mleczny frequented by students, this place may have the most variety of Polish dishes in one location in the whole city.
    -   [Bar Witek](https://goo.gl/maps/XGsfCsmHPSmY6sBB7): Wrocław is known for some places serving "tosty" (toasted sandwiches). This is one of the most famous places offering nothing but that. Naples has pizza, China has Dim Sum, Kraków has Zapiekanki, and Wrocław has... tosty:).
    -   [Browar Stu Mostów na Świdnickiej](https://goo.gl/maps/XQMB9sWZjaQXAWsK9): Sort of famous place in Wrocław.
    -   [Conspira - polish restaurant based on 80's](https://goo.gl/maps/qPizh2nBoQHPCPvaA):
    -   [IDA kuchnia i wino](https://goo.gl/maps/4AcMjM391YoCU2t88): Not fine dining, but high quality semi-fancy Polish food. Fairly cheap, considering.
    -   [Manufaktura Bezglutenowa](https://goo.gl/maps/XVX7pchVCLjwWc8G7): Gluten-free Polish food a little bit outside of the city. Given that most Polish food is normally heavily gluten based, this place is a real gem for those that can't eat gluten.
    -   [Młoda Polska bistro & pianino](https://goo.gl/maps/Z62zTCkeiN4XVy1m9)

    -   [SETKA](https://goo.gl/maps/LPqzCcRSqMpny5pu9): Styled to fit [Poland during the communist times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic), this place serves up shots, drinks, and classic Polish food.
    -   [Ze Smakiem](https://goo.gl/maps/uWXns5p8tCdb3Fk1A) (literally "with taste"): This writer's favorite place for pierogi in the whole country (they also serve borshch). A small place with just three tables, you can watch the cashier create their home-made pierogi. Servings include unusual fillings like salmon & feta & lemon grass and blue cheese & pear & honey, alongside Polish classics which are not easily available in restaurants such as chicken liver & cranberry and farmers cheese & buckwheat. A must visit in my humble opinion.

**Thai Food:**

-   -   [Tajfun](https://goo.gl/maps/gGpBtquBaj6gAmwA8): Surprisingly good Thai food for Poland.

**Ukrainian:**

-   -   [LVIV - kawior wódka bliny](https://goo.gl/maps/f3ZTgG1Xb5H44RGk7): Underrated and fairly unknown Ukrainian place serving high quality "modern" Ukrainian food.
    -   [Ukraińska Knajpa](https://goo.gl/maps/8EWeQBCz1196MBJz5): Ukrainian place serving high quality traditional Ukrainian food.

**Uzbekistan:**

-   -   [️Samarqand restauracja uzbecka](https://goo.gl/maps/em8rJKm32cNXi6r58): It would be naïve to assume that Uzbekistani food is just Russian food! This place gives a taste of Uzbek cuisine (especially the most traditional Uzbek food, **plov**). You can also smoke shisha in their designated area.

**Vegan & Vegetarian (Exclusively):**

-   -   [Bez Lukru](https://goo.gl/maps/vBnwVdQM6g7UCa356)
    -   [FALLA](https://goo.gl/maps/vYxZ5R5uF4Fvn27y7)
    -   [KASZA I PASZA WHOLESOME FOOD](https://goo.gl/maps/rAGFsgBtB4jzvGsRA)
    -   [PieRogi Vegan](https://goo.gl/maps/t1HWVy4BSPt5f18EA)
    -   [Pod przykrywką](https://goo.gl/maps/XoYM4cKVmmxoVU7L9): With just a few tables, this place offers Polish vegan food that not only tastes great, but is completely homemade by the owner/chef who will not only take your order, but come and chat. Highly recommended.
    -   [Soup Culture](https://goo.gl/maps/E7GjWpkegueMiiu67): Various soups which are served in a bread cone (aka: you can walk and eat/drink with it). Sort of a novelty, but the soups are good.
    -   [Talerzyki](https://goo.gl/maps/fPJwTQrLmaRu5LWq7): "Small plates" place with really good hummus, falafel, shakshuka, and other middle eastern inspired food.
    -   [Vega](https://goo.gl/maps/gKyt1XxuKtfLT8tr7): Surprisingly cheap, tasty, and healthy, this place offers Polish-inspired vegan dishes in the middle of the main square. There's two parts to this place: the ground floor, and the restaurant upstairs. I recommend the upstairs part.
    -   [w kontakcie](https://goo.gl/maps/CQxqqsYDSVDnxU7e7)
    -   [Warzywniak](https://goo.gl/maps/bAgbo5FhiRG6SPtr5)
    -   [Wilk Syty](https://goo.gl/maps/3thFnnoRbqXGgG7TA): Many vegetarian and vegan restaurants try to emulate or imitate meat-based dishes. This place does not. With its unique ever-changing menu that uses fresh seasonal ingredients, their food is a personal favourite and an amazing example of what food (*which just happens to be vegan*) can be.

**Hotels**

-   [Herbal Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/RJECbPZ7sBbhqLeS8): Newly rebuilt in an old monastery, the hotel has a nice wine cellar and is on one of the better streets within the city.

-   [The Bridge Wroclaw - MGallery](https://goo.gl/maps/pRPQMEgFGUGthbWa9): Perhaps the best hotel in the city with respect to: price, location, amenities, and location, this is a 5-star hotel with a gym, sauna, right in the heart of Ostrów Tumski. It's extremely quiet, their interior design is extremely well throughout with subtilises that make it even better, and if you have a window view you'll be mesmerized by the amazing Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. Apparently their restaurant great, too.

**Hostels**

-   [FOKA Hostel](https://goo.gl/maps/P8cstF6TzLfmNTY57): Slightly further away from the city, this place is not so much a tourist hostel than a place to rent rooms with many beds inside them. Extremely quiet in a big building and modern, high-quality design.
-   [Grampa's Hostel](https://goo.gl/maps/3VU88Shb3Y2Hp1kD8): Fully functional hostel with a nice kitchen and clean common area with yoga mats, many games and books and all the necessities you except from a tourist hostel. Exceptionally clean.

**Shopping**

-   [Feniks](https://goo.gl/maps/8SbWSN3odGYd2gTu7): Feniks is not a traditional department store and most likely doesn't fit into this category, but it is worth exploring. Built in 1904, the building has a fascinating [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barasch_Brothers%27_Department_Store) (much longer [in Polish](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%B3%C5%82dzielczy_Dom_Handlowy_%E2%80%9EFeniks%E2%80%9D_we_Wroc%C5%82awiu)) and is the type of thing you go and check out without the intention of buying anything.

The brutalist buildings hold an interesting history which can be read about on the architect's Wikipedia page: [Jadwiga Grabowska-Hawrylak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadwiga_Grabowska-Hawrylak). The accompanying Wikipedia page of the area can be found [here](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zesp%C3%B3%C5%82_mieszkalno-us%C5%82ugowy_przy_pl._Grunwaldzkim_we_Wroc%C5%82awiu) (in Polish).
-   Other interesting buildings in the city are those designed by Stefan Müller.
-   [The "Hansel and Gretel Houses"](https://goo.gl/maps/geegQ5dCwxfneUCD9) are an entrance to another church within the city, and the name comes from the interesting design of the buildings (note how small the rooms must be).

In 2022, the most well-known of the buildings, "[The Solpol Department Store](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_towarowy_Solpol)" which was located meters away from the opera house, was torn down.
-   [The Department of Chemistry's building](https://goo.gl/maps/JMVeSNaFgJyEKznCA) (of The University of Wrocław) is located within an architecturally interesting building of brutalist style.
