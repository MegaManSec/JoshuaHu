I've worked on a range of different projects over the years. Some of the more interesting ones (to me) are listed below.

- [Accurate Multi-Gas Emissions Equivalence Modelling of Greenhouse Gases](https://vrs.amsi.org.au/student-profile/joshua-rogers/)
- [Squid Caching Proxy: A Security Assessment]()
- [Game Lost: An Analysis of Video Game Preservation in the Digital Age](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/game-lost-analysis-video-preservation-digital-age-joshua-rogers/)
- [World of Nintendo: Exploring Nintendo in [Eastern] Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-DisAPdKF8&feature=youtu.be) and [Australian History: Bad Boys & Brawlers - The NES Downunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1drqSLzPM)
- [The Nintendo Entertainment System in South Africa](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-games-around-world-south-africa-joshua-rogers/)

There are some still-unpublished projects that I will add to this page eventually.
