title: "SSH-Snake: Automatically traverse a network using SSH private keys"
author: "Joshua Rogers"

Today I am officially releasing a tool that I'm proud to have finally finished: SSH-Snake.

To put it simply, SSH-Snake performs three basic tasks:

1.  On the current system, find any SSH private keys,
2.  On the current system, find any hosts or destinations (`user@host`) that the private keys may be accepted,
3.  Attempt to SSH into all of the discovered destinations using all of the private keys discovered.

The interesting thing about SSH-Snake, however, is that it can perform all of these tasks recursively: once it connects to a new destination, it starts tasks #1-#3 again. It continues this into perpetuity; or until no new keys/destinations are found.

---

The original goal of this project was quite simple: I wanted to create visual representations of systems that I was hacking using compromised SSH private keys. I was jumping between servers with SSH keys like it was a Super Mario game, and I wanted to automate the process of searching for new keys on each server and trying those keys to connect to new systems.

I thought about using cosmopolitan libc to build some type of binary which would run anywhere, but I wanted to create something that was minimalist (ironic, considering the script now contains over 1,250 lines of code sans comments), would run anywhere, and would could be executed filelessly. Using something like [remote exec](http://phrack.org/issues/62/8.html) could have solved the latter issue, but why complicate it when we can just use what a human would use? And to be frank, I like challenges: creating a worm in Bash is certainly a challenge. Why not POSIX? Well, I like _challenges_; I'm not a masochist.

---

As stated, the original output that I was interested in was visualizations. Just under 10 years ago, I was working with the well-known open source graph visualization tool [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) (_mostly experimenting with afl-fuzz which had just been released_), and I have seen how BloodHound is able to visualize trust relationships between endpoints in Active Directory networks, so I knew it wouldn't be too difficult to create something like that but for SSH: all I needed to do was to actually build the script.

In terms of those visualizations, the result is quite pretty:

![A graph visualizing the relation between systems using SSH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake/main/tools/SSH-Snake-dot-circo.png)

The blue nodes indicate the _destination_ can connect to itself (user@host<-->user@host). The red edges indicate that the connection is bi-directional (user1@host1<-->user2@host2).

![A graph visualizing the relation between systems using SSH](https://github.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake/raw/main/tools/SSH-Snake-Gephi.svg)

The green nodes indicate a _host_ (without a username) that can connect to itself (host1<-->host1). The green edges indicate that the connection is bi-directional (host1<-->host2). The gray host in the top right corner is the host that the script was initially executed on.

---

Both of these images represent a cluster of servers that are intrinsically linked with SSH. The first image was generated using graphviz, while the second one was built using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). As it turns out, graphviz can't handle extremely large networks and will simply crash with either out-of-memory or some other type of issue; that's where Gephi comes in.

The output of the script looks something like this:

The IP address is enclosed in brackets in this output (another output doesn't contain this style of output, and instead prints exactly which destination was used in the `ssh -i key $destination` command). The reason for the brackets is that it identifies the system: it uses `hostname -I` (or a different method if `hostname -I` is not available) to list all of the IPv4 addresses of the system. Why? Well, imagine a system has two IPv4 address: 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2. If we connect to root@10.0.0.1 and perform our scan, we might later access root@10.0.0.2; but we've already scanned this system, so we don't want to waste time scanning the system again: it's the same! Or, imagine if a system has 256 IPv4 addresses (for some reason): we would be spending an awfully long time connecting from 10.0.0.0->10.0.0.1->10.0.0.2->10.0.0.3->....->10.0.0.255. Also imagine how many effectively duplicate nodes we'd have on our graph!

Documentation and more information about running the script is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake](https://github.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake). There are various documents introducing you to how the script can be run and the various features, settings, tools, and outputs, that it provides.

The rest of this blog pertains to the technical details of how SSH-Snake works. I hope you enjoy!
